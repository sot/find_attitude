Find_attitude package documentation
===================================

The ``find_atitude`` package contains functions for determining Chandra fine-attitude
based only on the observed Y-angle, Z-angle, and magnitude of at least four ACA guide
stars.

The recommended way for use of this in an operational situation is via the Kadi web site
front end at `<http://kadi.cfa.harvard.edu/find_attitude>`_.  This requires being on the CfA
network via VPN.
